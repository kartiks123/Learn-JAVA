public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args) // This is the default function that is present there in JAVA.
    // static keyword is used to tell that we can print our function's value without creating/calling an object of the class.
    {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}

// Naming Conventions

// For classes, we use PascalConvention
// As our words changes, we mark first letter of the character as caps lock on.
// For functions, we use camelCaseConvention
// Means, the first letter is going to be in small/lowercase, rest names can be in uppercase.
